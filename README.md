## 📄 Project Overview 

**MatchFlow – Zero Paperwork, 100% Confidence** 🔒

MatchFlow is a web-based invoice reconciliation platform built to eliminate the tedious, error-prone process of manual invoice checking. Born from the real-world frustrations of a busy café owner juggling dozens of ingredients and line items, MatchFlow empowers any business—whether a small restaurant or an enterprise finance team—to:

- 📥 **Upload** a vendor’s PDF invoice in seconds  
- 🤖 **Extract** structured data (invoice number, date, line items, totals) via Azure Form Recognizer  
- 🔗 **Compare** against pre-recorded Purchase Orders  
- ⚠️ **Flag** any discrepancies for rapid human review  

The entire end-to-end flow—PO entry through discrepancy resolution—takes just one click, turning hours of spreadsheet work into instant confidence that you’re only paying exactly what you ordered.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who It’s For  
- 🏪 Small-to-medium businesses and enterprise procurement teams  
- ☕ Restaurant owners and café operators  
- 💼 Accounting and finance departments seeking to automate invoice matching  

### ❤️ Why You’ll Love It  
- ⏱️ **Save Time** — replace 1–2 hours of manual checks with a single click  
- 🛡️ **Reduce Risk** — catch pricing mistakes, duplicate invoices, or fraud before they post  
- 📜 **Full Audit Trail** — every upload, extraction, and approval is logged for compliance  
- 🌐 **Anywhere Access** — responsive web app works on desktop and mobile  

### 🚀 Tech Highlights  
- 📊 **OCR Accuracy:** Powered by Azure Form Recognizer to convert PDF invoices into queryable data  
- ⚙️ **Modern Stack:** React + Vite frontend, .NET 6 Web API backend, Azure Blob Storage, and SQL Server  
- 🔒 **Secure:** JWT-based authentication and role-based access controls  

MatchFlow delivers real, measurable value by automating repetitive finance tasks—so you can focus on your business, not on paperwork.
